# SshBruteC-
Simple ssh brute force script in c++. 


### Note; this script is for educational purposes only. Don't use it on the servers that are not owned by you.


Note; I've developed this script in c++ but python is much faster and easier in network programming. If you're considering coding something based on networking,
do it with python. <3
